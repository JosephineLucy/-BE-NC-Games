# Northcoders House of Games API
Welcome!

I am building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. 

The intention is to mimic the building of a real world backend service that should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Have a go at this project yourself by followiing the instructions below!


## Connect to the Databases Locally

Clone this repository and run the command, npm install to install the dependancies needed.


## Create Enviroment Variables
Create the environment variables by creating two .env files: 

.env.development
.env.test

In each file, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
